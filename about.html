            <h2> Pizza Mia</h2>
            <p>The growth in the American Pizza market in 1986 was what initially grabbed our attention. By 1995, Pizza
                was still the number one growth sector in the fast food industry. This decade of sustained growth in the
                U.S.A showed us that we had only realised the tip of the iceberg in the Irish market and that there was
                huge potential for growth. The Good Food Company recognised a service gap in the market for an Irish
                pizza delivery brand.Pizza Mia was launched in Dublin in 1996. We wanted a strong name that would
                reflect the fact that our pizzas are an original American style, as opposed to the original Italian
                style pizzas which have a different dough base.

                Pizza Mia was so named in the spirit of admiration and respect for the indigenous peoples of North and
                South America. The etymology of the word Mia is widely believed to have come from the Yuma word for
                'fighting men' and the Zuni word meaning 'enemy'. Mia, by definition, is a collective term for several
                culturally related groups of Native tribes who stood up against oppression under the incredible
                Geronimo.

                We are working hard to develop, evolve and improve Pizza Mia in a culturally sensitive and considerate
                way.</p>

            <h3> Focused On Our Franchise</h3>
            <p>We feel the primary reason for our rapid expansion is due to the fact that, unlike our competitors, we
                remain very focused on our franchisees.
                Under the leadership of our Managing Director, Lucy Tierney, Pizza Mia has refined and streamlined a
                user-friendly system that means people from all walks of life can come on board and learn the business
                with ease. This starts with the basics of making a pizza, right through to running several stores. For
